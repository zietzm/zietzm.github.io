# Getting Started with Astro and TypeScript

Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build faster websites with less client-side JavaScript. Combined with TypeScript, it provides a powerful toolkit for building type-safe websites.

## Why Astro?

Astro offers several advantages over other frameworks:

1. **Zero JS by default**: Astro strips away all JavaScript from your components, sending only the HTML to the browser.
2. **Component islands**: You can selectively hydrate interactive components.
3. **Framework agnostic**: You can use React, Vue, Svelte, or other frameworks.
4. **Excellent developer experience**: Fast builds and hot module reloading.

## Setting Up Your First Astro Project

To create a new Astro project with TypeScript support, run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-astro-project -- --template typescript
cd my-astro-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

A typical Astro project structure looks like this:

```
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Adding TypeScript

Astro has built-in TypeScript support. Create a `tsconfig.json` file at the root of your project:

```json
{
  "extends": "astro/tsconfigs/strict",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
      "@layouts/*": ["src/layouts/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Astro and TypeScript provide a powerful combination for building modern websites. With zero client-side JavaScript by default and type safety, you can create fast, maintainable websites.

In future posts, I'll dive deeper into specific Astro features and advanced TypeScript patterns.
